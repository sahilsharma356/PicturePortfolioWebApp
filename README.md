# PicturePortfolioWebApp

This web displays some of the pictures i liked while browsing the web. There is a feature to add new pictures in case i come across more
pictures that i find. 
This project was created to practice routing techniques as well as using ejs for embedded javascript. 
The app does not yet have a database, meaning that if the server is shut down all new pictures added will vanish. 
(currently reading docs for mongoDB to fix the problem above). 

To run the project: Download the repository on a local machine, using the command line run the app ($ node app.js). In a browser window
search "localhost:3000" . 

Enjoy the beautiful pictures :)
